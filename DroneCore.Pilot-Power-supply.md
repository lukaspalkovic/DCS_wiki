**DroneCore.Pilot power consumption**

Default system configuration consists of DroneCore.Pilot board connected with the Cube Orange and NVIDIA® Jetson Xavier™ NX Module. Power consumption of the whole system depends on usage of Jetson Xavier™ NX computing power and peripheral devices connected to board. 
We describe some default situations for reference. This paragraph assumes that NVIDIA® Jetson Xavier™ NX is in 20W power mode and no other peripheral is connected to board.
  
| System usage | Power consumption |
| ------ | ------ | 
| NVIDIA® Jetson Xavier™ NX booted but no user program code running
Cube Orange running | 20.1W | 
| 2 | reserved |
